# Coptic Pen
These are thoughts, feelings, poems, lyrics, biographies, translations, autobiography, essays, memoirs, stories and nonsense written in Coptic language. Why do I write in a dead language? What purpose does it serve? I find no rational satisfactory answer. Is it nonsense? I tend not to judge I just write in Coptic language. This is as far as this blog goes in English language.
