# Coptic Pen
These are thoughts, feelings, poems, lyrics, biographies, translations, autobiography, essays, memoirs, stories and nonsense written in Coptic language. Why do I write in a dead language? What purpose does it serve? I find no rational satisfactory answer. Is it nonsense? I tend not to judge I just write in Coptic language. This is as far as this blog goes in English language.

###### PS:
I do not tend to write translations. Except for psalis & doxologies, all translations from Sahidic are liberal, personal, with some changes and should not be taken as literal ones
